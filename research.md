### The Cone of Equidistant Circular Split Networks
My main research interests are in Algebraic Statistics and Algebraic Combinatorics, especially how they relate to  phylogenetic trees. My current thesis work is on equidistant circular network space. Phylogenetic networks are generalizations of phylogenetic trees which allow for some limited non-tree edges. Biologically, such edges can  be introduced through processes like reticulation events and hybridization. One such natural type of phylogenetic network is the circular split network. My research project is characterizing  the polyhedral geometry of distance matrices built from circular split systems which have the added property of being equidistant.  I have given a characterization of the facet defining inequalities and the extreme rays of the cone of distances that arises from an equidistant network associated to any circular split network. 


### Chromatic Symmetric Functions of Trees
 I have been collaborating with Spencer Daughtry on a project looking at chromatic symmetric functions of trees. We’ve been working on a bijection between stable matchings of vertices and set partitions of edges. We are investigating the properties of this potential bijection and ultimately we hope that this will lead to some results related to Stanely’s conjecture about uniquely defining trees by their chromatic symmetric functions.

### Identifiability of Phylogenetic Mixture Models
Prior research under Seth Sullivant was a paper with the goal of broadening the class of models
that the main theorem in a previous work by Rhodes and Sullivant applied to. This previous papers gave conditions for when a phylogenetic mixture model with an underlying General Markov Modelwas identifiable. The work I did expanded this condition to make statements about identifiability of some specific group-based models specifically the Jukes-Cantor (JC), Kimura 2 parameter model(K2P), Kimura 3 parameter model (K3P) and the Strand Symmetric model (SSM).

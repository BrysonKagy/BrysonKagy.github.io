My research area is global sensitivity analysis (GSA), a subfield of uncertainty quantification. We use GSA to identify which parameters or inputs have the most influence over the output of a model. It is a tool seeing growing use across mathematics and science. GSA can help researchers better understand the structure of complicated black box models, such as deep neural networks or biological mechanistic models). My projects focus both on methods and applications of GSA. 

### Surrogate-assisted global sensitivity analysis

Black box models often come with large computational expense. In these cases, it makes more sense to work with a surrogate model instead. This process introduces two sources of error in the global sensitivity analysis. The first one is due to the approximation error of the surrogate and the second one due to the error in estimating the surrogateâ€™s sensitivity indices. Sampling of the surrogate is often considerably cheaper than sampling the underlying model. However, this sampling can still be costly. In the best case, we can derive analytic formulas for the surrogate model.

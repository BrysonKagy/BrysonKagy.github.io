### Outreach
Instructor at the North Carolina Governor's Honors school - Raleigh, NC Summer 2023

An exclusive summer program for gifted high schoolers from across North Carolina. I designed and taught a class on graph theory and combinatorics for a rotating group of 50 students. I also mentored groups on math research projects and gave electives on cryptography to the general student body.


Math Doesn't Bug Me - Raleigh, NC Fall 2019

Volunteered to help with the math department's exhibit at the  BugFest at the NC Museum of Natural Sciences. I helped design a couple of interactive games that taught some basic graph theory to children. I helped run these games on the day of the event.

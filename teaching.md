My research area is global sensitivity analysis (GSA), a subfield of uncertainty quantification. We use GSA to identify which parameters or inputs have the most influence over the output of a model. It is a tool seeing growing use across mathematics and science. GSA can help researchers better understand the structure of complicated black box models, such as deep neural networks or biological mechanistic models). My projects focus both on methods and applications of GSA.
